## [v0.6]

Released on Jan 13, 2023

- General

  - Operator `//` for integer division implemented (#92)
  - Operator `%` for modulo operation implemented
  - Area syntax `@(...)` for in-place reader extend (#78)
  - Character-class syntax changed from `[a-z]` into `Char<a-z>`, `.` and `Any` substituted by `Char` (#98)
  - Improved syntax for inline blocks and sequences (`|`-operator)
  - Improved list syntax
    - `()` the empty list
    - `(1,)` list with one item (explicit comma required)
  - Implemented `x[...]` item access syntax for rvalue and lvalue (#80)
  - Preliminaries for generic parselets (#10)
  - New built-in signatures (#84)
- Compiler
  - Parser
    - `parser.rs` is now generated from `tokay.tok`; syntax-changes are only done in `tokay.tok` now! (#93)
    - Removed `macros.rs` and macro-based bootstrap parser entirely
  - Internal revision
    - Removed structs `Usage` and `ImlResult`
    - Integrating all `impl Compileable`s into `ImlOp`
    - Code construction now happens in `ImlOp` as well
    - Added required changes to
      - determine whether a part of code consumes input
      - preliminaries to generic parselets (yet unfinished)
  - `prelude.tok` provides some default-parselets defined in Tokay itself
    - `Number` matches either `Float` or `Int`
    - `Token` matches arbitrary tokens
- Virtual Machine
  - Internal refactoring of the essential `Context::collect()`-function (#67)
  - `Frame` is now managed by `Context`
- Values
  - Turned Value::Int to crate [num-bigint](https://crates.io/crates/num-bigint), replaced Value::Addr by the same type (#55)
  - Definition of mutable objects; Imutable objects push a clone of, mutable objects push a ref on the object
  - `dict` now allow for any non-mutable value as key (#96)
- Builtins
  - Added `dict.clone()`, `dict_push()`, `dict.pop()`, `dict.get_item()`, `dict.set_item()`, `list.get_item()`, `list.set_item()`, `str.get_item()`
  - Renamed `dict_update()` into `dict_merge()`
- Examples
  - The self-hosted Tokay parser in `examples/tokay.tok` was now moved into `src/compiler/tokay.tok` and is used to generate `src/compiler/parser.rs` (#93)
  - The JSON parser example in `examples/json.tok` was improved to latest developments

    - `repr()` to get string with Tokay object representation
    - `type()` to get string of Tokay value type
    - bool methods: `bool()`

    - `Ident` renamed (from `Identifier`)
    - `Int` renamed (from `Integer`) and accepting parameters like a radix base
