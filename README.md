An imperative, procedural programming language dedicated to parsing and other text-processing tasks.

**Tokay is still in alpha-state; There are plenty of bugs and incomplete features. Please [help to improve it](#contribute)!**

## About

Tokay is a programming language designed for ad-hoc parsing.

Tokay is a language made to quickly create solutions in text processing problems. This can either be just simple extractions from any data, but also parsing the entire data, and turning it into a structured parse tree or abstract syntax tree for further tasks.

Therefore, Tokay provides both a language for simple one-liners, but also features to create tools for code-analysis, refactoring, interpreters, compilers, transpilers or even entire domain specific languages. Even [Tokay's own language parser](examples/tokay.tok) is implemented with Tokay itself.

Tokay is inspired by [awk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK), but follows its own philosophy and design principles. It might also serve as a general purpose scripting language, but it mainly focuses on processing textual input and work on trees with information extracted from this input.

Tokay is a very young project and gains much potential. [Volunteers are welcome!](#contribute)

## Highlights

- Concise and easy to learn syntax
- Stream-based input processing
- Automatic parse tree construction and synthesis
- Left-recursive parsing structures ("parselets") supported
- Implements a memoizing packrat parsing algorithm internally
- Robust due to its implementation in only safe [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- Enabling awk-style one-liners in combination with other tools
- Generic functions and parselets (*coming soon)
- Import system to create modularized programs (*coming soon)
- Embedded interoperability with other programs (*coming soon)

## Examples

Tokay's implementation of "Hello World":

```tokay
print("Hello World")
```

Tokay can also greet any wor(l)ds fed to it:

```tokay
world => Word   print("Hello " + $world)
```

A simple program counting words from any input:

```tokay
Word ++words accept
end words
```

By design, Tokay constructs syntax trees from consumed information automatically.

The next example implements a grammar for parsing and evaluating simple mathematical expressions, like `1+2+3` or `7*(8+2)/5`. Processing direct and indirect left-recursions without ending in infinite loops is one of Tokay's core features. There is [also a version of this program](examples/expr_with_spaces.tok) accepting whitespace between all tokens.

```tokay
Factor : @{
    Integer             # built-in 64-bit signed integer token
    '(' Expr ')'
}

Term : @{
    Term '*' Factor     $1 * $3
    Term '/' Factor     $1 / $3
    Factor
}

Expr : @{
    Expr '+' Term       $1 + $3
    Expr '-' Term       $1 - $3
    Term
}

Expr
```

Tokay can also be used for programs without any parsing features.<br>
Next is a recursive attempt for calculating the faculty of a value.

```
faculty : @x {
    if !x return 1
    x * faculty(x - 1)
}

faculty(4)
```

## Documentation

The full documentation of the language is currently work-in-progress, and can be obtained on the website [tokay.dev](https://tokay.dev). The documentation source code is maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/tokay-lang/tokay-docs).

## Contribute

Contributions of any kind, might it be code, bug reports and fixes, documentation, support or advertising are always welcome!

Take a look into the [bug tracker](https://github.com/phorward/tokay/issues) or watch for `//fixme`- and `//todo`-comments in the source code for open issues and things that need to be improved (there are plenty of them).

Feel free to [contact me](https://phorward.info) on any questions, or directly [file an issue here](https://github.com/phorward/tokay/issues/new).

Tokay is my first project I've started in Rust, therefore I'm sure many things inside the code could easily be improved by more experienced Rustaceans out there.

If you want to create a pull request, ensure that `cargo run` and `cargo test` run without errors. When new features where added, don't miss to write some unit tests for them. Run `cargo fmt` before you finally commit.

## Logo

The Tokay programming language is named after the [Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokay_gecko) from Asia, shouting out "token" in the night.

The Tokay logo and icon was designed by [Timmytiefkuehl](https://github.com/timmytiefkuehl), many thanks to him!
